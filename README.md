# YARA RULES

YARA rules are basically pattern-matching rules used to detect malware, suspicious files, or specific behaviors in cybersecurity. Think of them like digital "wanted posters" for malicious code. They're written in a simple rule-based language that looks for specific strings, binary patterns, or characteristics in files, memory, or network traffic.

They're super useful for threat hunters, malware analysts, and security researchers because they help automate the detection of known threats. You can use them in tools like VirusTotal, Threat Hunting platforms, and even SIEMs to catch bad stuff before it spreads.

YARA was originally created by Victor Alvarez while working at Panda Security, and it's now an open-source project widely used in cybersecurity. If you're into malware analysis, writing good YARA rules is a must!
